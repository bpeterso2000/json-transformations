JSON Transformations
====================

    Aspires to use Python to teach users to train Python to reliably solve
    JSON data extraction and transformation problems without code.

Micro packages
    a slight twist on existing, traditional, JSON Unix-like tools to make accessing and transforming the JSON data both easy and fun.

Requests composer
    a fun way to copy & paste info from API docs and quickly turn it into reliable, composable, flexible, scriptable, command-line applications.

JSON translations calculator
    simply JSON in, to JSON out, via JSON rules made from friendly Python tokens; fun and not too scary. Record, rewind, forward, pause and play.

Parallel Processing
    functional, immutable â€“ well suited to parallel processing.

Cloud sharing/Open exchange
    share and exchange extraction and transformation solutions in the cloud.

Machine Learning
    use machine learning to help teach users to train the application how to extract and transform data.  There are lots of existing patterns in this space that can be dynamically learned; quit reinventing the wheel.
